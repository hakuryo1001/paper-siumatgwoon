Consider the old siumatgwoon axioms, and a new relation "synonym", represented by ~, read as "is synonymous with". It satisfies the following axioms.

S1. (reflexivity) for all $x\in S$, $x\sim x$.
S2. (symmetry) For all, $a,b\in S$, if $a\sim b$ then $b\sim a$.
S3. (transitivity) for all $a,b,c \in S$, if $a\sim b$, and $b \sim c$, then $a \sim c$.

S4. (Compositional congruence) If $a \sim a'$, then (if they $ax$ or $xa$ exists):

- $ax \sim a'x$,
- $xa \sim xa'$

S5. Composition cancellation

- If $a * b \sim a * c$, then $b \sim c$;
- If $b∗a\sim c∗a$ then  $b \sim c$;

S6. Divisier compatibility: If $a \sim b$, then for all $x \in S$, $x|a$ iff $x|b$.

S7: Upwards divisibility : If $a∼b$, then for all if $a|x$ then $b|x$.

A Siumatgwoon is Synonym-Closed if in which if $a∗b$  exists and $a∼a'$ and $b∼b'$ then $a'*b, a*b', a'*b'$ also exist. Most siumatgwoons, including the Sinoglyphs, are not synonym-closed. 

Because of S4, Synonym-Closed Siumatgwoons must have $a*b \sim a'*b \sim  a*b'\sim  a'*b'.$ 

% ### **S8: Synonym Replacement and Existence Preservation**

% - 

% Synonym replacement completion: if $a*b$ exists, and if $b\sim b^{’}$, then $a*b^{'}$ exists in S as well.

% Prior to this, we are rather ambiguous and coy as to whether a and b being synonymous means b*x necessarily exists if a*x exists. I feel we should admit closure for synyonym substitutional compositions. We can consider other structure where this axiom is not admitted later.

% S9. Multidecomposition if $ab \sim cd$ and $cd = e$ then $ab =e$. 

% From S4 you'd be able to prove that $a \sim a'$ and $b\sim b'$ then $a * b \sim a' * b'$.

% - The quotient siumatgwoon $S/\sim$
    
%     ## 1. Starting Point: Synonymy ~ as an Equivalence Relation
    
%     Let $S$ be a Siumatgwoon, and let $\sim$ be a synonymy relation on $S$ satisfying:
    
%     - $\sim$ is an equivalence relation: reflexive, symmetric, transitive.
%     - $\sim$ is **compatible with composition**:
        
%         If $a\sim a^{'}$, $b\sim b^{'}$, then $a*b\sim a^{'}*b^{'}$.
        
%     - $\sim$ is **compatible with divisibility**:
        
%         If $a\sim b$, then $x∣a  ⟺  x∣b$ for all  $x\in S$.
        
    
%     These give us a solid foundation to define a quotient structure.
    
%     ---
    
%     ## The set $S/\sim$
    
%     Let:
    
%     $S/∼=\{[a]:a\in S\}$
    
%     where $[a]=\{x∈S∣x\sim a\}$ is the **equivalence class** of $a$.
    
%     ---
    
%     ## 3. Defining the Operations on $S/\sim$
    
%     ### **Multiplication:**
    
%     We define:
    
%     $[a]∗[b]:=[a∗b]$, if $a*b$ exists.
    
%     This is well-defined **because of compositional congruence** (axiom S4′).
    
%     It is also because that we required if $a*b$ exists, so must $a^{'}*b^{'}$.
    
%     That is: if $a \sim a^{'}$, and $b \sim b^{'}$, then:
    
%     $a∗b∼a^{'}*b^{'}\Rightarrow [a∗b]=[a^{'}*b^{'}]$
    
%     So the result is independent of the representative.
    
%     ---
    
%     ### **Divisibility:**
    
%     We define:
    
%     $[a]∣[b] \iff  a∣b$
    
%     Again, this is **well-defined** thanks to the **divisibility equivalence** axiom (S5):
    
%     - If $a\sim a^{'}, b \sim b^{'}$, given we have the axiom that  $a∣b  ⟺  a^{'}|b^{'}$ then:
    
%     $[a]*[b] ⟺  [a^{'}]∣[b^{'}]$
    
%     Thus, | descends to the quotient.
    
%     ---
    
%     ## 4. Verifying Siumatgwoon Axioms in $S/∼$
    
%     Let’s verify that the **quotient structure inherits** the original Siumatgwoon axioms:
    
%     - **Axiom 1 (Reflexivity of** $|$ **)**:
        
%         Since $a∣a⇒[a]∣[a]$
        
%     - **Axiom 2 (Totality)**:
        
%         For all $[a],[b]$, either $[a]∣[b]$ or not.
        
%         This follows since $|$ on $S$ has totality, and divisibility is preserved under $\sim$.
        
%     - **Axiom 3 (Transitivity)**:
        
%         Suppose $[a]∣[b]$ and  $[b]∣[c]$. Recall the definition that $[a]∣[b]$ then $a∣b$. It’s straightforward.
        
%     - **Axiom 4 (Composition and divisability)**:
        
%         We want to prove that if $[a]∗[b]=[c]$, then $[a],[b] | [c]$.  By definition $[a]∗[b]=[c]$ then $a*b\sim c$, and so $a|c$. By the definition of constitutiveness over synonym classes, $[a]|[c]$. The argument same goes for $[b]|[c]$.
        
%         Now come axioms 5 and axioms 6. Do they hold in $S/ \sim$, even if they might not hold in$S$?
        
%         - Axiom 5 (Complete Constructibility and Generators): There exists a non-empty subset $G_{S} \subseteq S$ such that:
%             - (Generation) Every element $x \in S$ is a product of a finite sequence of elements from $G_S$, i.e., $x = g_1 * g_2 * \cdots * g_n,$  where $g_1, \dots, g_n \in G_S$
        
%         And a Simple Siumatgwoon is one where:
        
%         1. $E$ is a generating set, and 
%         2. that decompositions into elementals are unique.
        
%         - Axiom 5 (Complete Constructibility and Generators): There exists a non-empty subset $G_{S} \subseteq S$ such that:
%             - (Generation) Every element $x \in S$ is a product of a finite sequence of elements from $G_S$, i.e., $x = g_1 * g_2 * \cdots * g_n,$  where $g_1, \dots, g_n \in G_S$
%         - Axiom 6. (Finite constitution). For any $x \in S$, there are only finitely many objects $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n \in S$ such that  $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n | x.$
        
%         Let’s proof that axiom 5 holds first. And then axiom 6 holds. Then we prove that $S/\sim$ is a simple siumatgwoon.
        
%         Consider some element $[x] \in S/\sim$. Given $S$ is a siumatgwoon, we know that any $x$ has a finite decomposition $g_1 * g_2 * g_3 * \cdots g_n$. Given $x=g_1 * g_2 * g_3 * \cdots g_n$, we have $[x]=[g_1 * g_2 * g_3 * \cdots g_n]$, and by the definition of $[*]$ we have $[x]=[g_1 * g_2 * g_3 * \cdots g_n]=[g_1] * [g_2] * [g_3] * \cdots [g_n]$. Given this applies to every $x$ in $S$, it is true of every $[x]\in S/\sim$. 
        
%         Note that some of the $[g_i]$ might be equal to some other $[g_j]$ if $g_i \sim g_j$.
        
%         Now for axiom 6.
        
%         Consider $[x]\in S/\sim$. By axiom 6, there only finitely many $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n | x.$ Therefore there are only finitely many $[y_1], [y_2], \ldots, [y_n] | [x].$ Note again, that because there could be $y_i \sim y_j$, then the most reduced list of constituents for $[x]$ might be shorter than $n$.
        
%         Axiom 5 says
        
%     - **Axiom 5 (Generators)**:
        
%         If G⊆SG \subseteq SG⊆S is a generating set, then [G]={[g]∣g∈G}⊆S/∼[G] = \{ [g] \mid g \in G \} \subseteq S/{\sim}[G]={[g]∣g∈G}⊆S/∼ generates all of S/∼S/{\sim}S/∼
        
    
%     Hence, S/∼S/{\sim}S/∼ is a well-defined **quotient Siumatgwoon**.
    
%     ---
    
%     ## 🌀 5. Interpretation of S/∼S/{\sim}S/∼
    
%     - **Elements of S/∼S/{\sim}S/∼** are **semantic classes**: bundles of expressions that mean the same thing.
%     - **Operations and structure** are all inherited from how the parts combine.
%     - This is essentially a move from **syntax to semantics** — a form of canonical simplification.
    
%     ---
    
%     ## 🧠 Bonus: Identity and Atoms in S/∼S/{\sim}S/∼
    
%     - The set of **atomic classes** would be:
    
%     A/∼={[a]∣a∈A}A/{\sim} = \{ [a] \mid a \in A \}
    
%     A/∼={[a]∣a∈A}
    
%     If synonymy is strong (e.g., if all synonyms of atoms are equal), then this is a **true set of atomic meanings**.
    
%     - The quotient set **removes redundancy**: if two characters are written differently but function identically, they’re collapsed.
% - A hierarchy of synonym relations
    
%     Intuitively speaking, the ~ of 言～文 that allows us write 信～伩 seems different from the ~ in 女～巫, as it does not seem the case that 女 can be exchanged for 巫 in all chinese characters. This suggests that there is a hierarchy, or rather, a family of synonymous relations, perhaps context dependent. 
    
%     Some synonymns are more closely clustered together than others. This suggests there is a hierarchy of synonymns.
    
% - A foray into the axioms of the Siumatgwoon - 31st March 2025
    
%     A Siumatgwoon, or a Metaphysic, is a set $S$, paired with the binary relations *composition* $* : S \times S \rightarrow S$ and *constitution* $|:S\times S \rightarrow \{True, False\}$ , such that the following axioms hold. 
    
%     - Axiom 1 (Reflexivity): For all $a \in S$, $a|a$.
%     - Axiom 2 (Totality): For all $a,b\in S$, exactly one of the following holds: $a|b$ or not $a\not|b$
%     - Axiom 3 (Transitivity): For all $a,b,c\in S$, $a|b$ and $b|c$ implies $a|c$.
%     - Axiom 4: If $a*b=c$ for some $a,b,c\in S$, then
%     $a|c$ and $b|c$.
    
%     Some further clarifications: 
    
%     - $a\not|b$ iff $a|b = false$
    
%     Some examples of Siumatgwoons: 
    
%     1. The Chinese characters, **字**
%         1. The Chinese characters, which inspired this whole mathematical exercise, is clearly a Siumatgwoon. If we exercise the synonym exchange of “Siumatgwoon” with “Metaphysic”, this is to say, that the Chinese characters is a Metaphysic. Unfortunately we can’t really *prove* that the Chinese characters are indeed a siumatgwoon, given there’s an infinite number of them, and we do not have a generating rule for all Chinese characters. However, the fact that any subset of Chinese characters is a siumatgwoon in of itself, lends us confidence - perhaps there’s a theorem there waiting to be proved?
%     2. The Roman Numerals $\mathfrak{R}$
        
%         One can clearly see that Roman Numerals $\mathfrak{R}$ are a Siumatgwoon. However, to appreciate the characteristics that make it a Siumatgwoon, let us consider the subset of Roman Numerals from 1 to 10, which we shall show to also be a Siumatgwoon.
        
%         $\mathfrak{R}_{1,10} = \{I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X\}$
        
%         We will say that for two elements $a,b \in \mathfrak{R}_{1,10}$, $a|b$ iff the glyph $a$ appears in $b$. As such, we can say $I | II$ and $I|III$ as an example, and that $V|IV$ and $X|IX$. 
        
%         For any elements $a,b\in \mathfrak{R}_{1,10}$, if the glyphs $ab$ so written together forms a glyph that also appears in $\mathfrak{R}_{1,10}$, then we’d say that $a*b\in \mathfrak{R}$.
        
%         Now, it’s clear that Ax 1 is satisfied trivially. 
        
%         Ax 2 is also satisfied trivially.
        
%         Ax 3 is also satisfied. 
        
%         Ax 4 is also satisifed. As an example: $I | III, III | VIII$ and we have $I|VIII$.
        
%         So therefore, $\mathfrak{R}_{1,10}$ is a Siumatgwun. 
        
%         It is also interesting to note that as per the definition of $\mathfrak{R}_{1,10}$, it is not compositionally closed. For example, $II * III$ is not in $\mathfrak{R}_{1,10}$. This makes the Siumatgwoon different from a group, where all compositions are contained inside the group. Intuitively, perhaps this suggests the Siumatgwoon is less rich in structure that the mathematical group? Also, note that what $II * III$ should be in $\mathfrak{R}_{1,10}$ is represented by $V$. Intuitively, we can feel that in some sense, $II * III = V$ - that they’re synonymous, identical, referring to the same referent. This is not unlike the presence of variant characters in the Sinoglyphs, such as 體 (body, object)=骵=躰=体, or信 (trust) = 𬢭 = 伩 = 訫 = 㐰… Intuition should hint that this will yield some interesting structures if we pursue the investigation down this path.
        
    
%     1. **(Any?) Numerals system** 
%         1. The fact that the Roman Numerals are a Siumatgwoon should intuitively suggest that any numeral system is a Siumatgwoon. In fact, let us consider the world’s many numeral systems, and see if there is one where it is not a siumatgwoon.

%         I don’t think there’s a single one that’s not a siumatgwoon! Most of them are pathological for sure, in the sense that nothing is constituted by anything else, but none of them violate the Siumatgwoon axioms! 
        
%         The case of the numerals as a Siumatgwoon, or a Metaphysic, is interesting. Numerals all refer to the same referents, the same “things” or “objects”, namely, numbers. However, the glyphs in a given numeral system are themselves imbued with a particular set of metaphysical prejudices and judgements. Under the Roman Numeral Metaphysic, the number 3 is composed of 1 and 2, or composed of three 1s. 4 is composed of 1 and 5, but not 3 and 2. 
        
%     2. The polygons $\mathcal{P}$
        
%         Consider the following graph. If we take all the polygons, convex and star, as elements in a set called $\mathcal{P}$, we can see that it forms a Siumatgwoon.  We state this without formal proof for the infinite set $\mathcal{P}$, but from the subset displayed in the graph below, we can see it is indeed true. A polygon $a$ constitutes polygon $b$ if $a$ appears in $b$$\{3\}$, the equilateral triangle, appears in $\{6/2\}$, the star of David, and so $\{3\} |\{6/2\}$
        
%         The Schläfli symbol is a recursive description, starting with $\{p\}$ for a $p$-sided regular polygon that is convex. For example, $\{3\}$ is an equilateral triangle, $\{4\}$ is a square, $\{5\}$ a convex regular pentagon, etc.
        
%         Regular star polygons are not convex, and their Schläfli symbols take the form $\{p/q\}$, where $p$ is the number of vertices and $q$ is their turning number. Equivalently,  $\{p/q\}$ is created from the vertices of  $\{p\}$ by connecting every  $q$th vertex. For example,  $\{5/2\}$ is a pentagram, while  $\{5\}$ is a pentagon.
        
%         Note that in $p$ and $q$ must be [coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime), or the figure will degenerate, in which case we have the following theorem:
        
%         $\{p/q\}=d\{ \frac{p}{d} / \frac{q}{d}  \}$, where $d=gcd(p,q)$.
        
%         Let us define for any schlaffi symbol $\{p\} | n\{p\}$ for any n. It is intuively true.
        
%         Then clearly axiom 1 is satisfied. Axiom 2 is also satisfied. If

%     ![image.png](attachment:4d2e52da-b773-4554-88e2-8e9cce7fd6f1:image.png)
    
%     There are 3 flavours of * in Propositional Logics, $\wedge, \vee →$. 
    
%     And we define $\phi | \psi$ if $\phi$ appears in $\psi$, for any wff $\phi, \psi$.
    
%     Then clearly all 4 of the core siumatgun axioms are satisfied. 
    
%     1. Trivial that all $\phi | \phi$
%     2. Also trivial that for any $\phi, \psi$, either $\phi|\psi$ or $\phi\not|\psi$.
%     3. Trivial as well that for any $\phi,\psi | \phi * \psi$.
%     4. Also trivial that if $\phi | \psi$ and $\psi | \theta$ then $\phi | \theta$.
    
%     Propositional Logic as a Siumatgoon has multiple interesting properties: 
    
%     1. It is compositionally complete. 
%     2. It is also constitutionally complete. 
%     3. Is it a simple siumatgun? Are decompositions finite? Yes. Are deccmpositions unique? Yes, up to reordering. So yeah, it’s a simple siumatgwoon.
